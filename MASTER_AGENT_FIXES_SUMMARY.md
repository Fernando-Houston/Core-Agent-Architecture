# Master Intelligence Agent - Query Response Variety Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

The Houston Intelligence API was returning the same generic response for all queries. The following improvements were implemented to provide varied, contextual responses:

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Query Analysis
- Added `extract_query_context()` method to understand:
  - Property types mentioned
  - Action type (investment, development, rental)
  - Whether rankings or comparisons are requested
  - Time frame context
  - Price range indicators

### 2. Dynamic Agent Response Generation
- Modified `query_specialized_agent()` to generate different responses based on:
  - Query context (ranking requests, specific topics)
  - Keywords in the query (permits, trends, financing)
  - Location-specific data when neighborhoods are mentioned
  - Action type (investment vs development vs rental)

### 3. Context-Aware Executive Summaries
- Updated `generate_executive_summary()` to:
  - Check for specific query patterns first
  - Generate targeted summaries for common query types
  - Include relevant metrics in the summary
  - Adapt language based on intent and context

### 4. Improved Recommendations
- Enhanced `generate_recommendations()` to provide:
  - Context-specific advice based on query type
  - Actionable items extracted from agent insights
  - Relevant recommendations for the user's stated goal

### 5. Dynamic Next Steps
- Updated `suggest_next_steps()` to offer:
  - Query-specific action items
  - Practical next steps based on context
  - Relevant follow-up activities

## Example Response Variety

### Query: "What are the best neighborhoods for investment?"
**Response**: Focused on neighborhood rankings with specific ROI data, appreciation forecasts, and investment-specific metrics.

### Query: "Show me recent building permits"
**Response**: Provided permit statistics, trends, approval times, and area-specific permit activity.

### Query: "What are the current market trends?"
**Response**: Highlighted mixed-use development trends, office conversions, green building adoption, and tech sector influence.

### Query: "Tell me about Houston Heights"
**Response**: Delivered neighborhood-specific data including median prices, walk scores, development pipeline, and local market characteristics.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Query Context Extraction**: Analyzes queries for specific patterns, keywords, and intent
2. **Dynamic Data Selection**: Chooses appropriate data points based on query context
3. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent provides context-aware responses
4. **Response Synthesis**: Combines agent outputs intelligently based on query needs

## Result

The Houston Intelligence API now provides:
- Contextually appropriate responses
- Specific data relevant to each query
- Varied insights and recommendations
- Dynamic executive summaries
- Query-specific next steps

This ensures users receive targeted, useful information rather than generic responses.
