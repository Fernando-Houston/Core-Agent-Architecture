## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Use specific filters** to reduce response size
2. **Cache responses** for data that doesn't change frequently
3. **Batch similar requests** when possible
4. **Monitor rate limits** in response headers

## üÜò Troubleshooting

- **Empty results**: Check if agents have been populated with data
- **500 errors**: Verify knowledge files exist in agent folders
- **Rate limits**: Implement exponential backoff
- **CORS issues**: Ensure origin is whitelisted
