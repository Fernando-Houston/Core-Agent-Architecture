# T3 Agent Population Engine

## Houston Development Intelligence Platform - Knowledge Architecture

The T3 Agent Population Engine is the final stage in our 3-terminal intelligence pipeline, responsible for transforming T2's analyzed intelligence into structured knowledge bases that power our 6 specialized AI agents.

## Architecture Overview

```
T1 (Data Extraction) → T2 (Intelligence Analysis) → T3 (Agent Population)
                                                      ↓
                                            6 Specialized AI Agents
```

## Core Components

### 1. **t3_population_engine.py**
   - Main engine that monitors T2 completions
   - Processes intelligence insights into structured records
   - Manages cross-domain intelligence mapping
   - Generates 1,200+ intelligence files

### 2. **agent_population_toolkit.py**
   - Specialized populators for each agent domain:
     - MarketIntelligencePopulator
     - NeighborhoodIntelligencePopulator
     - FinancialIntelligencePopulator
     - EnvironmentalIntelligencePopulator
     - RegulatoryIntelligencePopulator
     - TechnologyInnovationPopulator

### 3. **cross_domain_mapper.py**
   - Creates intelligent connections between domains
   - Identifies cross-domain synergies
   - Generates recommendations for integrated insights

### 4. **knowledge_base_schema.json**
   - Defines the structure for all intelligence records
   - Ensures consistency across agent knowledge bases

## Usage

### Starting the Engine

```bash
# Make the launcher executable
chmod +x t3_launcher.sh

# Start the T3 engine
./t3_launcher.sh
```

### Manual Processing

```python
from t3_population_engine import T3PopulationEngine

# Initialize engine
engine = T3PopulationEngine("/path/to/base")

# Process T2 completions once
engine.process_t2_completions()

# Or start continuous monitoring
engine.continuous_monitoring(check_interval=30)
```

## Intelligence Record Structure

Each intelligence record contains:
- Unique ID and timestamp
- Domain and category classification
- Structured content with key findings
- Geographic and temporal relevance
- Cross-references to related intelligence
- Confidence scores and data points

## Cross-Domain Intelligence

The system automatically identifies and maps relationships between different domains:
- Tag-based connections
- Geographic overlaps
- Temporal alignments
- Domain-specific interactions
