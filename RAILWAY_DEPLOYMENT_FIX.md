# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Agent Folder Path Mismatch**
- **Problem**: The code was looking for folders like "Market Intelligence Agent" but actual folders were named "Market Intelligence" (without "Agent")
- **Fixed**: Updated `master_intelligence_agent.py` lines 78-84 to use correct folder names
- **Fixed**: Updated `houston_intelligence_endpoints.py` to use proper path mapping

### 2. ✅ **Missing Knowledge Files**
- **Problem**: Agent folders were missing `capabilities.json` and `latest_insights.json` files that the API expects
- **Fixed**: Created these files with placeholder content for all agents

### 3. ⚠️ **Deployment Configuration Conflict**
- **Problem**: Conflicting startup commands:
  - `railway.json`: Uses `python houston_intelligence_api.py`
  - `railway.toml`: Uses `gunicorn houston_intelligence_api:app`
  - `Procfile`: Uses `gunicorn houston_intelligence_api:app`
- **Recommendation**: Use gunicorn for production (railway.toml and Procfile are correct)
- **Action**: Delete or update railway.json to match

### 4. ✅ **Dependencies**
- All required dependencies are properly listed in requirements.txt
- No missing imports found
- No circular imports detected

## Root Cause Analysis

The 502 Bad Gateway error was likely caused by:
1. The app starting successfully but crashing when trying to access agent folders that didn't exist
2. When endpoints like `/api/v1/agents` or `/api/v1/query` were called, they tried to access non-existent paths
3. This caused unhandled exceptions that crashed the gunicorn worker

## Deployment Commands

To deploy the fixed version:

```bash
# 1. Remove conflicting config (optional but recommended)
rm railway.json

# 2. Commit the changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix agent folder paths and add missing knowledge files"

# 3. Push to Railway
git push railway main
```

## Test Endpoints After Deployment

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# List agents (this was likely failing before)
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/agents

# Get platform stats
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/v1/stats
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Add error handling**: Wrap agent folder access in try-except blocks
2. **Add logging**: Log when agent folders are not found
3. **Add startup validation**: Check all required folders exist on startup
4. **Environment variables**: Consider using env vars for folder paths

## Files Modified

1. `master_intelligence_agent.py` - Fixed agent registry paths
2. `houston_intelligence_endpoints.py` - Added proper path mapping
3. Created `capabilities.json` and `latest_insights.json` in all agent folders

The deployment should now work correctly with these fixes!
