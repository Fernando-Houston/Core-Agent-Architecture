# 2024–2025 Construction Finance \& Delivery Outlook for Greater Houston

Houston’s building market weathered rising interest rates, sticky cost inflation, and an acute craft-labor gap in 2024 yet still advanced more than \$24 billion of commercial starts. Developers now face a tighter but still-liquid lending environment, cost escalators that are moderating—but not reversing—and municipal fee structures that vary dramatically by jurisdiction. The following report distills five interlocking forces shaping project feasibility through 2025: debt pricing, capital supply, impact fees, construction inflation, and workforce constraints.

## 1. Debt Pricing: Construction Loan Rates and Spreads

### 1.1 Short-Term Rate Trajectory

- Average floating construction loans for stabilized industrial, multifamily, and mixed-use builds ended 2024 near 8.0% (SOFR + 330 bps), down 40 bps from the October 2023 peak but still double 2021 levels[^1][^2].
- Banks re-entered the market after mid-2024 once deposit outflows abated, capturing 34% of non-agency originations in Q1 2025—up from 22% the prior quarter[^3].
- Life-company “mini-perm” programs priced 10- to 36-month money at 6.5–7.0% for credit tenants, offering developers term-out certainty at final completion[^4].


### 1.2 Risk-Based Spreads

| Property Type | Typical LTC | 2024Q4 All-in Rate* | Y/Y Change | Commentary |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Industrial BTS | 70% | 7.25% | –25 bps | Port-linked demand kept margins tight[^5]. |
| Garden MF | 65% | 7.90% | –15 bps | Agencies still absorbing perm take-outs. |
| Spec Office | 55% | 9.25% | +70 bps | Bank share <10%; debt funds dominate[^6]. |
| Hospitality | 60% | 9.50% | +55 bps | Underwriting assumes ramp risk. |

*Weighted average of bank and debt-fund quotes for Houston transactions >\$20 million.

### 1.3 Developer Implications

1. Forward-rate hedges now cost ~1.2% of notional; sponsors should model cap premiums versus staged take-downs.
2. Construction-to-perm executions (“one-time close”) can trim 30–50 bps in fees and eliminate re-underwrite risk—particularly appealing for owner-occupied medical and life-science space[^7].

## 2. Capital Availability

### 2.1 Loan Maturities \& Refi Wall

Texas faces \$10 billion of multifamily and construction debt maturing in 2024 alone, with 17% in construction buckets[^8]. Lenders prioritize:

- Projects ≥70% complete with fresh equity injections.
- Industrial near the Ship Channel or Grand Parkway due to faster lease-up assumptions.


### 2.2 Alternative Capital Sources

- Regional-bank participation pools are resurfacing for deals under \$40 million, easing single-bank exposure limits.
- C-PACE funded \$210 million in Houston retrofits in 2024—up 60% y/y—as borrowers swapped out high-coupon mezzanine.
- Municipal IDA bonds financed 1.4 million ft² of workforce multifamily, shaving 180 bps versus conventional perm debt.


## 3. Development Impact Fees by Municipality

Impact fees for water, wastewater, roadway, and drainage can swing total project cost by 2–5% depending on jurisdiction.

### 3.1 Houston (City Limits)

- Updated impact-fee schedule effective FY 2026 targets 32% of maximum allowables: \$2,498 water + \$1,788 wastewater per EDU, phased in from \$1,618 + \$1,622 in FY 2022[^9].
- Drainage fee remains usage-based (impervious area) rather than service unit.


### 3.2 Suburban Comparisons

| Municipality (2024) | Water + Sewer Fee / SF unit | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Austin | \$7,200 | Highest in state; offsets Colorado River plant. |
| San Antonio | \$7,200* | Multiple zones; average shown. |
| Fort Worth | \$3,500 | 70% of maximum. |
| City of Houston | \$3,240 | Below 2010 national median. |

![Houston’s combined water and wastewater impact fees remain less than half of Austin or San Antonio, suggesting lower upfront developer costs.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/336c4618ffc13d7d2f1fac234239bc29/66017a7b-f4fa-41e1-bc43-3ee5f19929b3/2a2340f1.png)

Houston’s combined water and wastewater impact fees remain less than half of Austin or San Antonio, suggesting lower upfront developer costs.

### 3.3 Special District Charges

- Brookshire-Katy Drainage District levies \$2,500 per acre review fee plus channel easement dedication[^10].
- League City raised roadway impact fee caps to \$1,842 per vehicle-mile in 2024, effective on plat recordation[^11].


## 4. Construction Cost Inflation

### 4.1 Materials \& Index Trends

Turner’s Building Cost Index climbed 2.7% y/y to 1,432 by Q3 2024, driven mainly by mechanical/electrical equipment and copper pricing[^12].

![Turner Building Cost Index rose 2.7% from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, underscoring steady construction cost inflation.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/336c4618ffc13d7d2f1fac234239bc29/b268576a-a39d-4fbd-ab46-a04a8174a3dc/51013cb2.png)

Turner Building Cost Index rose 2.7% from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, underscoring steady construction cost inflation.

- Commodity steel pricing stabilized, with mill H-beam quotes flat at \$1,010/ton since February 2024[^13].
- Concrete products increased 6% y/y on kiln-fuel surcharges[^14].
- Houston-specific contractor surveys (Kirksey) show Class-A office core-shell at \$405/ft², up 4% over 12 months[^15].


### 4.2 Cost Escalation Outlook

Consensus among GC pre-con teams projects 4–5% escalation for 2025, front-loaded into Q2 on expected Fed easing and rebid activity.

## 5. Labor Shortage and Schedule Risk

### 5.1 Magnitude of the Gap

- Texas contractors reported 76% difficulty filling hourly craft roles; 34% of Houston projects experienced delays directly tied to workforce shortages[^16][^17].
- AGC estimates the state needs an extra 63,000 construction workers in 2025 to meet demand[^18].


### 5.2 Schedule Impact

Industry surveys peg median delay at 20% of baseline duration when projects miss key trades, adding roughly three months to a 14-month tilt-wall warehouse[^19][^20]. Critical path extensions stem from:

1. Long-lead switchgear and air-handlers (52 weeks).
2. Shortage of licensed electricians and journeyman pipefitters—Houston wage premiums rose 11% in 2024[^21].
3. Permit backlogs in fast-growth suburbs (8–12 week added review time).

### 5.3 Mitigation Strategies

- Pre-fab MEP racks executed off-site cut onsite man-hours 18% in recent port-submarket builds.
- Incentive retainage: some GCs now release half at rough-in to keep subs on schedule.
- Owners adopting escalation clauses tied to ENR CCI or Turner Index to share inflation risk.


## Conclusion: Key Takeaways for 2025 Projects

1. **Debt Costs Will Ease—but Marginally.** Expect sub-8% construction coupons only for low-leverage industrial or mixed-income housing; budget 25–50 bps spread compression, not a wholesale reset.
2. **Liquidity Has Shifted to Alternative Debt.** C-PACE, credit-union club deals, and life-company bridge loans fill gaps left by regional banks. Sponsors should allocate time for multi-party agency review.
3. **Houston’s Impact Fees Remain Competitive.** At ~\$3,200 per dwelling equivalent they are less than half Austin/San Antonio, offsetting some finance cost pressure. Monitor annual CPI indexation post-2026.
4. **Inflation Persists at a Lower Gear.** Material escalation is slowing, but complex equipment and labor premiums keep overall cost growth around 4%—embed allowances accordingly.
5. **Labor Scarcity Is the Primary Schedule Threat.** Early trade buy-out, prefabrication, and collaborative scheduling remain essential as the city contends with a half-million-worker national gap.

Developers who lock in financing early, leverage Houston’s relatively modest fee regime, and bake realistic labor contingencies into schedules will be best positioned to capitalize on the metro’s continued logistics and population expansion in 2025.
