# Houston’s 2024 Industrial Real Estate Landscape: Port‐Powered Growth, Logistics Expansion, Rising Land Values, and the Energy Transition

Houston closed 2024 as **one of the fastest-growing industrial hubs in North America**.  Three forces converged:

1. **A once-in-a-generation widening of the Houston Ship Channel (Project 11).**
2. **A construction boom in modern logistics facilities driven by retail and e-commerce demand.**
3. **A surge of clean-energy manufacturers selecting the region for gigafactory-scale plants.**

Together they pushed container traffic to record highs, tightened warehouse vacancy to the mid-6 percent range, and propelled quoted land prices above \$180 per square foot in the best-served submarkets[^1][^2][^3].  The following report unpacks each theme and examines the implications for investors, developers, and occupiers.

## 1. Port Houston Expansion and Its Ripple Effects

### 1.1  Project 11: Deeper, Wider, Sooner

- The \$1 billion **Project 11** program will widen the main ship channel to 700 ft and deepen key reaches to 46.5 ft; as of mid-2025 roughly 70 percent of the dredging mileage is complete, keeping the 2025–26 delivery schedule intact[^4][^5][^6].
- Completion of Segment 1B in early-2025 allowed the Houston Pilots to lift daylight restrictions for neo-Panamax vessels, adding roughly two hours of daily sailing window and expanding berth productivity at Bayport and Barbours Cut[^7].


### 1.2  Container Throughput: A Near-Doubling in Eight Years

Port Houston shattered its previous records by handling **4.14 million TEU in 2024, up 8 percent year-over-year and 90 percent above 2016 levels**[^8][^7].  Loaded exports—dominated by resins—grew 10 percent, while loaded imports climbed 12 percent on strong retail goods[^7][^9].

### 1.3  Industrial Real Estate Impact

* **Vacancy Compression:** Market-wide vacancy dipped to 6.7 percent in Q4 2024 despite 19.3 msf of new deliveries, as port-proximate users back-filled speculative supply[^10][^11].
* **Rent Growth:** Triple-net warehouse rates averaged \$0.81 psf/month in Q1 2025, an annual jump of 5 percent that pushed headline asking rents to an all-time high[^12][^3].
* **Tenant Profile Shift:** Resin baggers, transloaders, and third-party logistics (3PL) firms captured more than 60 percent of new port-adjacent leasing in 2024, a sharp rise from 44 percent two years earlier[^13][^2].


## 2. Logistics \& Warehouse Development Trends

### 2.1  Construction Pipeline and Geographic Hotspots

Developers broke ground on 16.2 msf in 2024, but cautious capital markets trimmed total space under construction to 13.4 msf—less than half the 2022 peak[^2][^14].  Activity is highly concentrated:


| Submarket | Space Under Construction (MSF) | Notable Projects (≥600 KSF) | Pre-Lease Rate |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Northwest Far | 3.4 | Tesla Brookshire Megapack DC; First Liberty Logistics Center | 41%[^15][^16] |
| East-Southeast Far | 2.5 | Phase III Bay Area Business Park; Port 99 Logistics | 44%[^17][^2] |
| North Far | 2.2 | NorthPort Logistics Center; Generation Park BTS | 53%[^18][^19] |
| East-Southeast Near | 2.1 | greensPORT Logistics Park; Cedar Port IV | 38%[^20][^21] |

![Houston Industrial Space Under Construction by Submarket, Q4 2024](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/e3d5bba934e01bc34452927caee73a37/724e4a7b-5a64-4c8f-9cec-30e33ec5c7ea/5fb0ab82.png)

Houston Industrial Space Under Construction by Submarket, Q4 2024

### 2.2  Demand Metrics

* **Net Absorption:** Houston posted 19.1 msf of positive net absorption in 2024, the fourth-best year on record and triple the pre-pandemic average[^10][^13].
* **Deal Size Drift:** The median new lease shrank to 117 ksf as retailers trimmed safety-stock footprints; however, mega-leases (>750 ksf) still accounted for 8 percent of 2024 volume, led by Amazon, Costco, and BroadRange Logistics[^14][^22].


### 2.3  Capital Flows and Pricing

Institutional buyers remained net acquirers, led by Hines’ \$300 million purchase of the 1.9 msf Boulevard Oaks portfolio at a 5.4 percent cap rate[^2].  Core-plus trades averaged \$120 psf—up 9 percent year-over-year—even as national volumes slid[^23][^10].

## 3. Industrial Land Prices in 2024

| Submarket | Typical Quoted Price (psf) | 2023 → 2024 Change | Drivers |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| East-Southeast Near (Channelview/La Porte) | \$18–24 | +14% | Port truck drayage savings, limited entitled acreage[^20][^24] |
| Northwest Far (Katy/Waller) | \$12–16 | +11% | I-10 \& SH-99 access, Tesla \& Home Depot absorption[^15][^25] |
| North Far (Conroe/New Caney) | \$10–14 | +9% | 80-mile Houston–Dallas I-45 corridor freight growth[^26][^27] |
| Southwest (Fort Bend/Richmond) | \$8–12 | +7% | Population expansion, Amazon Richmond FC anchor[^28][^29] |

Sales above \$25 psf now occur only for rail-served or deepwater-dock parcels; Partners Capital’s 153-acre Aldine Westfield assemblage reportedly cleared \$11 psf raw, underlining the premium for shovel-ready tracts[^26].

## 4. Amazon and the Evolution of E-Commerce Logistics

### 4.1  New Facilities Announced or Delivered in 2024

| Facility | Size | Location | Function | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Amazon Clay 99 Sort Center | 806 ksf | Katy | Regional sortation | Operating[^30] |
| Richmond Robotics Fulfillment Center | 850 ksf | Fort Bend Co. | Large-sortable goods | Ramp-up Q3 2024[^28] |
| Porter Delivery Station | 140 ksf | North Houston | Last-mile | Opened Q2 2024[^30] |
| Sequoia Pilot FC | Retrofit | Houston (Code “HOU7”) | High-density robotics | Full deployment 2024[^31] |

Amazon leased or built **>2 msf of incremental space** in the metro during 2024 even while nationally trimming square footage, underscoring Houston’s strategic value in its regionalization model[^31][^32].

### 4.2  Technology and Labor Implications

The **Sequoia** robotics storage system introduced in Houston identifies, stows, and retrieves inventory 75 percent faster than legacy solutions, cutting order cycle times by a quarter and materially raising throughput per square foot[^31].  These efficiency gains are motivating other retailers—Five Below, Lowe’s, and Costco among them—to demand 40-ft clear heights and heavy power in speculative buildings[^14].

## 5. Energy Transition Manufacturing Wave

Houston’s industrial market is no longer powered solely by hydrocarbons; a roster of clean-tech producers selected the region in 2024–25, committing more than \$500 million of direct capital and millions of square feet of specialized space.


| Company | Facility Type | Square Feet | CapEx | Operational Date | Local Jobs |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **SEG Solar** | N-type module plant (2 GW) | 250 ksf | \$60 m | Q4 2024 | 500[^33][^34] |
| **John Cockerill Hydrogen** | Electrolyzer gigafactory (1 GW/yr) | 500 ksf (retrofit) | \$130 m* | Q3 2024 | 200[^35][^36] |
| **Tesla Energy** | Megapack battery megafactory | 1.6 msf | \$194 m | Q1 2026 | 1,500[^15][^37] |
| **Amogy Inc.** | Ammonia “powerpack” assembly | 53 ksf | \$40 m | Q1 2024 | 200[^38] |

\*Includes \$34 m federal 48C tax credit

These projects target infill or rail-served brownfields along SH 146, SH 225, and the SH 288-SH 99 corridors, absorbing chunks of existing inventory and spurring new BTS demand for adjacent suppliers.

### 5.1  Real-Estate Requirements

1. **Heavy power \& water:** Electrolyzer and battery plants require ≥20 MW of redundant electricity and substantial process water, favoring Channelview and Baytown sites tied into CenterPoint’s 138 kV grid[^35].
2. **Multimodal access:** Solar-panel and hydrogen skid logistics rely on container drayage plus on-dock rail—advantages uniquely offered by the Cedar Port and greensPORT zones[^21][^20].
3. **Clear-height tolerance:** Clean-tech lines can be housed in 32-36 ft clear boxes, allowing conversions of former FMC and Halliburton warehouses, which accelerates time-to-market versus greenfield builds[^38].

### 5.2  Economic Multiplier

Greater Houston Partnership estimates every 1 million ft² of advanced manufacturing adds **1,000 direct and 1,800 indirect jobs**, equating to **over 6,000 new positions** tied to the four headline projects above—a welcome diversification from cyclical oilfield goods[^39].

## Conclusion

Port Houston’s widened channel is already translating into **larger ships, higher cargo velocity, and unprecedented export throughput**, anchoring demand for modern logistics space.  Developers responded with **selective, well-located projects**—but capital discipline and scarce entitled land have cooled the supply wave, positioning rents for renewed growth in 2025.

At the same time, **Amazon’s robotics roll-out and the arrival of multi-gigawatt clean-energy factories** signal a broader industrial renaissance that extends beyond pure distribution.  For investors, the opportunity lies in port-proximate, rail-served land and in retrofitting older warehouses with higher power capacity.  For occupiers, early commitments will be essential to secure space in the tightest submarkets as Project 11 reaches completion and energy-transition manufacturers bring thousands of skilled workers to the region.

Houston’s industrial market has always thrived on the city’s “make-move-market” ethos.  In 2024, that engine shifted into a higher, greener gear—and the runway for continued expansion looks longer than ever.
