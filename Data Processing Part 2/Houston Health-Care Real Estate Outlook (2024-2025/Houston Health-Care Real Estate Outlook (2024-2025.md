# Houston Health-Care Real Estate Outlook (2024-2025)

Greater Houston is spending more than **\$4 billion on new hospitals, clinics, and life-science space through 2025—anchored by a \$1.6 billion trauma‐tower outside the Texas Medical Center (TMC), brisk suburban hospital builds, and an unprecedented wave of medical-office leasing**. Telemedicine, meanwhile, is reshaping space needs rather than eliminating them: Houston remains the state leader in Medicaid telehealth providers even as large systems double down on destination campuses.

## 1. Texas Medical Center: A New Growth Cycle

### 1.1  Helix Park \& BioPort

* TMC opened the 250,000-sq-ft Collaborative Building in 2023, launching the 37-acre **Helix Park** life-science district that will reach 6 million sq ft by 2027[^1][^2].
* A **500-acre BioPort** biomanufacturing campus was announced, projected to add 100,000 jobs over 10 years[^3].


### 1.2  Flagship Hospital Expansions

| System | Project | Cost | Delivery |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Memorial Hermann | Sarofim Pavilion build-out (6 floors) | \$270 M | 2027[^4][^5] |
| MD Anderson | New \$239 M research facility on Bertner | 2027[^4] |  |
| Baylor St. Luke’s | \$25 M Bates Ave. renovation | 2025[^6] |  |

### 1.3  Real-Estate Implications

* Helix Park’s first industry building is 70% leased to Houston Methodist and Baylor; life-science asking rents have crossed **\$46 psf NNN**, 30% above 2021 levels[^2][^7].
* Land south of Old Spanish Trail is trading 20-35% higher year-over-year as mixed-use developers queue projects near the new campus[^8][^9].


## 2. Hospital Construction Beyond the Loop

| Project | Submarket | Beds Added | Cost (US\$M) | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Harris Health LBJ Replacement** | Northeast Houston | 390 (expandable 450) | 1,600 | Groundbreaking May 2024[^10][^11] |
| Memorial Hermann Cypress North Tower | Cypress | 58 | 277.5 | Under way 2024-27[^12] |
| Houston Methodist West \& Fulshear Care Center | Katy/Fulshear | +36 Obs beds \& 65 k-sf clinic | 247 | 2024-27[^13][^14] |
| Houston Methodist Kuykendahl Mega-Center | Spring | 120 k sf outpatient | n/a | 2026-27[^15] |

Top hospital capital projects fueling Houston’s healthcare building boom.

**Takeaway:** Capital is shifting to high-growth suburbs, but the single largest check—LBJ—targets an underserved urban quadrant, signaling equity as well as capacity goals.

## 3. Senior Living Pipeline in the Suburbs

### 3.1  Active Projects (Select)

* **Watercrest at Kingwood Phase II** – 101 independent/assisted units, \$9.1 M, completes 2025[^16].
* **The Buckingham Expansion (Galleria)** – \$56 M adding 104 IL units and higher-acuity beds[^17].
* **Upland Drive \& Tidwell affordable senior apartments** – 219 LIHTC units backed by Harris County ARPA funds, delivering 2026[^18][^19].
* **Clearwater at The Heights** – 220-unit luxury assisted living, acquired 2024[^20].


### 3.2  Demand Drivers

* Metro 65+ population rose **4.8% in 2024**—double the national pace—pushing Houston’s senior-housing occupancy to 84.5%, still trailing the U.S. average of 88.1% but tightening rapidly[^21].
* New county code now requires backup generators in all assisted-living facilities by end-2025, adding retrofit costs but boosting resilience value[^22].


## 4. Medical Office \& Outpatient Market

### 4.1  Fundamentals Q4 2024

* **Net absorption:** 770,000 sf 12-mo., No. 1 among U.S. markets[^23][^24].
* **Direct vacancy:** 12.4% overall; on-campus 9.9%, off-campus 14.5%[^23].
* **Pipeline:** 738,000 sf under construction; 94% pre-leased, concentrated along US-290, The Woodlands, and Sugar Land[^23].


### 4.2  Rent \& Investment

* Asking rents hit **\$31.63 psf full-service**—Inner Loop up 6% q-o-q[^23].
* Cap rates compressed 10 bps in Q2 2024 to 6.9% as Houston led the nation with **1.4 M sf** of MOB absorption[^25][^26].


### 4.3  Outpatient Shift

* Health-system leases accounted for 46% of new MOB deals in 2024; specialty groups (psych, ortho, GI) another 31%[^27].
* Retail and office conversions rising as Class-A medical space scarcity pushes providers into alternative shells\#\#\# 4.4  Development Hot-Spots
Submarkets showing triple-digit net absorption in 2024 were Sugar Land (+220 ksf), 290 Corridor (+213 ksf), The Woodlands (+160 ksf) and Clear Lake (+108 ksf), underpinned by suburban hospital satellites and payor shift to same-day surgery centers[^23]. Developers continue to favor two-story, 45–120 ksf footprints that can be condominium-ized for physician ownership, a hedge against future rate pressure.


## 5. Telemedicine \& Virtual‐Care Real Estate Effects

Houston embraced telehealth during the pandemic and has retained more virtual capacity than any other Texas market.

* **1,487 Medicaid providers** delivered telemedicine services in FY-2023—marginally ahead of Dallas–Fort Worth and nearly triple San Antonio’s count[^28].
* The city’s **ETHAN** emergency-telehealth platform is being spun into a regional corporation to sell services to neighboring counties and insurers, targeting breakeven after grant funding ends in 2025[^29].
* Houston Methodist’s Virtual Urgent Care now averages **6,000 video visits per month**, integrated with system ambulatory sites to funnel imaging and lab demand back to bricks-and-mortar campuses[^30].
* Insurers increasingly require “digital front door” capability in network contracts; major landlords report that suites under 3,000 sf with redundant broadband lease 6–12 months faster than comparable second-generation space, despite higher TI per foot.

![Houston leads the state in Medicaid telemedicine providers.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/4cf54222ff85566f2190dbc1b3260e3a/1b38e8db-0bd2-4b64-b9cd-bb601ec587a8/764853c2.png)

Houston leads the state in Medicaid telemedicine providers.

**Implications for Space Planning**

1. **Hybrid Clinic Design:** New MOBs allocate 25–30% of floor area to call-center pods, tele-triage rooms and asynchronous monitoring stations, substituting for some exam rooms but not for high-revenue imaging or procedure suites.
2. **Bandwidth \& Redundancy:** Tenants demand fiber backbones and onsite generator capacity—requirements once limited to data centers—aligning with county backup-power mandates for senior facilities[^22].
3. **Hub-and-Spoke Networks:** Systems are clustering digital command centers at flagship campuses (e.g., Memorial Hermann’s Sarofim Pavilion tele-ICU) while pushing routine follow-ups to suburban satellites, sustaining office demand even as virtual encounters rise.

## 6. Outlook \& Strategic Takeaways

1. **Capital Concentration:** More than \$3 billion of the current pipeline will deliver by 2027, skewed to trauma, women’s \& children’s, and rehab beds. Expect construction inflation and labor shortages to favor CM-at-Risk contracts and phased shells.
2. **MOB Tightness to Persist:** With vacancy already below 10% on-campus and limited 2025 deliveries, rent growth should hold near 2% annually, outpacing general office but below Sunbelt peers where availability is thinner[^23][^31].
3. **Senior Living Diversification:** Luxury IL/AL projects chase affluent enclaves (The Heights, Galleria), while LIHTC developers and housing authorities add much-needed affordable stock in north and east corridors—both segments benefiting from generator mandates that raise barriers to entry[^18][^22].
4. **Telehealth as Demand Engine:** Rather than shrinking footprints, virtual care shifts space mixes (exam → studio) and intensifies connectivity specs. Houston’s first-mover advantage in Medicaid telehealth suggests durable demand for digitally enabled suites through the decade.

## Conclusion

Houston’s health-care real-estate cycle is entering a **dual-track phase**: mega-projects at the Texas Medical Center and LBJ campus will redefine tertiary and trauma capacity, while suburban hospitals, outpatient hubs and senior-living campuses follow population growth rings. Coupled with nation-leading telemedicine adoption, the result is a market where **demand for well-located, tech-ready medical space is outstripping new supply**, supporting rent resilience and elevated construction activity through at least 2027—even if broader office fundamentals remain soft. Stakeholders positioned near growth corridors, transit axes and fiber nodes stand to capture the next wave of Houston’s medical build-out.
