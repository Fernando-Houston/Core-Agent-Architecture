# Capital Currents: How Money Flowed into Houston Real Estate in 2024

Houston’s commercial‐property market attracted an estimated **\$12.4 billion in fresh equity commitments during 2024**, led by private-equity bets on logistics warehouses, value-priced multifamily portfolios, and a revival of suburban mixed-use projects. Overseas buyers re-entered selectively—Mexican, Indian and Chinese capital accounting for more than half of cross-border home purchases—while local pension systems quietly pumped a record \$210 million into real-estate funds. Completed Opportunity-Zone deals topped \$1.1 billion as long-gestating East End and Fifth Ward projects delivered first phases.

## 1.  Private-Equity Plays: Bigger, Cheaper, Industrial

### 1.1  Headline Acquisitions

Houston logged eight PE transactions above \$100 million, overwhelmingly in logistics and workforce apartments:


| Closed 2024 | Buyer | Target | Price (\$ mn) | Sector | Notes |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Apr | Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust | 25-building TX/IL logistics portfolio (6 MSF, 8 in Houston) | 718 | Industrial | Crow Holdings seller; 95% leased[^1][^2] |
| Jul | KKR Real Estate Partners Americas III | Park 8Ninety logistics park, Missouri City | 234 | Industrial | 1.8 MSF, 12 bldgs from Artis REIT[^3][^4][^5] |
| Jun/Jul | Hamilton Point Investments Fund VII | Four newly built garden-apartment assets (1,174 units) | 195 | Multifamily | Avg. \$166k/unit after 20% price reset[^6] |
| May | Lone Star Capital | Three affordable-partnership complexes (896 units) | 180 | Multifamily | Acquired from Cortland at 25% discount[^7] |

Houston’s PE buyers paid an average **\$117 psf for warehouses**—roughly 9% below 2023—and **\$155k/unit for 2022-vintage Class B apartments**, down 22% year-on-year, illustrating the market-wide price reset that deep-capital sponsors exploited[^8][^9][^10].

### 1.2  Why Industrial Dominated

1. Port of Houston container volume up 20% y/y through May 2024, hitting record 3.4 million TEUs[^11].
2. New speculative starts plunged 80% from 2022 peak, tightening 2025–26 pipeline[^12][^13].
3. Rent growth held at 6–7% despite vacancy rising to 6.7%—making cash-on-cash yields compelling relative to still-elevated debt costs[^14][^15].

Selective big-ticket private-equity and REIT buys illustrate the 2024 deal spectrum.

## 2.  REIT Activity: Selective Buys, More Sales

Institutional REITs were net sellers (-\$286 million), but three themes emerged:

* **Shopping-center rotation:** Whitestone REIT recycled \$60 million of suburban assets to fund the \$41 million Garden Oaks center along North Shepherd, chasing younger-family demographics[^16][^17].
* **Industrial exit:** Canada’s Artis REIT monetised Park 8Ninety for US\$234 million, redeploying into debt pay-down amid strategy reset[^18][^19].
* **Multifamily upcycle:** Canadian-listed BSR REIT redeployed AvalonBay proceeds into two 2023-built north-side luxury properties for US\$141 million, banking on tech-corridor job growth[^20].


## 3.  Cross-Border Capital: Mexico Still Rules the Condo Floor

International buyers spent **\$3.5 billion on Texas homes** (April 2023–March 2024), 13% of which landed in Greater Houston. Shares by nationality: Mexico 37%, India 9%, China 6%, Canada 4%, U.K. 3%[^21][^22]. Houston brokerage data suggest roughly **\$460 million of that total** closed in Harris-Fort Bend counties—mostly west-side condos and Katy SFR rentals, with cash buyers dominating (48%).

![Mexico dwarfs other foreign buyer groups, accounting for over a third of Texas home purchases.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/8b238835df87e00afb201579c0133e55/75542398-616d-498b-a34b-e41d75f4c24d/eea008f4.png)

Mexico dwarfs other foreign buyer groups, accounting for over a third of Texas home purchases.

### Key Drivers

* Peso strength and nearshoring push kept high-net-worth Mexicans active despite U.S. rate hikes.
* Indian engineers relocating for energy-tech roles favoured Cypress and Pearland new-builds.
* Canadian funds retreated from office but expanded into ground-lease and build-to-rent platforms via CPP Investments’ \$789 million Bridge Industrial JV[^23].


## 4.  Opportunity-Zone Deliveries: From Plans to Product

Houston saw **seven OZ projects reach completion** in 2024, delivering 1.3 million sq ft and 720 housing units:


| Project | Submarket | Delivered 2024 | Capital Stack | Highlight |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| East End Maker Hub (300k sf) | Second Ward | Feb | \$37 mn NMTC + OZ equity | Advanced-manufacturing incubator[^24] |
| The Ion (266k sf rehab) | Midtown | Sep | Rice Mgmt + Hines QOF | Anchor of 16-acre Innovation District[^24] |
| East River Phase I | Fifth Ward | Nov | Midway QOF + MetLife debt | 300k sf office/retail + 360 apts[^24] |
| Ironworks Milby | Greater Eastwood | Dec | Kaldis QOF | 60k sf creative office/food hall[^25] |

OZ sponsors cited **10-year zero-gain treatment** and City-backed Chapter 380 grants as decisive in closing construction loans during the highest-rate environment since 2007[^26][^24].

## 5.  Pension-Fund Allocations: Quiet but Growing

Houston-area retirement systems upped real-estate targets to buffer equity volatility:

* **Houston Police Officers Pension System (HPOPS)**
    * Added \$15 million to Neuberger Berman Real Estate Secondary Opportunities II; total 2025 pacing \$105 million[^27][^28].
    * Portfolio now 10.3% real estate (\$747 mn) with a 7.1% FY-2024 return, outperforming benchmark by 20 bps[^28].
* **Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS)**
    * Committed \$250 million to two U.S. value-add funds in 2024, but cut overall real-estate target from 15% to 13% amid negative 5.5% one-year performance[^29][^30].
    * New strategic asset-allocation (effective Sept 2024) reduces office exposure, reallocates to specialty housing and infrastructure[^30].
* **Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (Houston exposure)**
    * Sold three legacy Houston office towers but injected US\$300 million follow-on equity into Encino Acquisition Partners and co-led an \$800 million U.S. industrial JV, underscoring shift toward logistics and energy adjacencies[^31][^32].


## 6.  Outlook for 2025

1. **Transaction volume rebound.** Debt costs are stabilising; expect industrial cap-rate compression of ~25 bps, reviving mid-market trades.
2. **Foreign buyer mix to broaden.** Early 2025 visa-stamp reforms could bring Brazilian and Nigerian family offices into suburban build-to-rent deals.
3. **Pension appetite pivots to credit.** Rising redemption queues will push systems like HPOPS to preferred-equity and income-fund sleeves, moderating direct‐equity firepower.
4. **OZ phase-two funding gap.** Interest deferral sunsets in 2026; sponsors must accelerate leasing or refinance with C-PACE and green bonds.

## Conclusion

The 2024 investment cycle reset Houston pricing yet reaffirmed its core appeal: **port-driven industrial demand, outsized population growth, and a policy toolkit (OZ, Chapter 380, TIRZ) that narrows risk for long-term capital**. Diversified private‐equity firms seized the moment, REITs trimmed non-core assets, cross-border buyers cherry-picked safe suburban rentals, and pension funds recalibrated toward specialty niches. With the supply pipeline throttling back and debt markets thawing, Houston enters 2025 poised for a fresh upswing in deal flow—albeit with sharper underwriting and a heavier tilt toward logistics, lower-cost multifamily and mixed-use nodes in the east‐side Opportunity Zones.
