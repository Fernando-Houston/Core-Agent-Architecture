# Education, Enrollment, and Real Estate in Greater Houston (2024–2025)

Houston’s K-16 landscape is reshaping regional property markets: suburban school districts climbed the performance league tables, HISD redrew boundaries amid enrollment loss, private-school demand soared, and universities announced more than \$400 million of new construction—all forces that investors now price into land and housing decisions[^1][^2].

## 1. Public School District Performance in 2024

### 1.1 Ranking Frameworks

Children at Risk’s 2023-24 ranking uses STAAR proficiency, year-over-year growth, and college readiness to grade 1,502 Houston-area campuses[^3].
The Texas Education Agency’s long-delayed A–F release applies tougher cut scores, producing only four “A” districts in the metro—Tomball, Friendswood, Barbers Hill, and rural Devers ISD[^1][^4].
Crowdsourced indices mirror the official data: Niche’s 2025 list places Tomball, Friendswood, Pearland, Katy, and Clear Creek in the top five, each with A or A+ composite grades[^5].

### 1.2 Districts on the Rise

Suburban systems captured the highest composite scores. Tomball ISD and Friendswood ISD both posted 91 out of 100 under TEA accountability, reflecting >70% meets-grade-level rates in reading and math[^1].
Lamar CISD advanced six slots in Children at Risk’s league table, buoyed by 28% five-year enrollment growth that allowed the district to open two STEM-focused high schools and keep class sizes under 24[^2].
Katy ISD recorded the largest absolute student gain in Texas—11,935 since 2020—yet still delivered a “B” (88) rating, illustrating how economies of scale can coexist with strong performance[^2].

### 1.3 Districts Under Pressure

Houston ISD improved internally—“A” or “B” campuses rose from 93 to 170 after the New Education System rollout[^6]—but the district’s overall rating remained a “C” and 65 campuses held D’s or F’s, the highest failure count statewide[^7][^8].
Enrollment fell another 8,600 students in 2024-25, a 5% single-year drop that accelerated the post-pandemic slide to –33,334 since 2019[^8][^9].

![Enrollment gains in suburban districts contrast sharply with losses in core urban Houston ISD, 2020-25.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/72e32c4bef47572ad525a9951b879487/ee65152b-a4c8-43e0-bba7-70e3811eb115/b8d849cd.png)

Enrollment gains in suburban districts contrast sharply with losses in core urban Houston ISD, 2020-25.

## 2. Boundary Changes and Property-Value Ripple Effects

### 2.1 HISD’s New “Separate \& Unique” Zones

In April 2024 the state-appointed board reclassified Helms Elementary and Wharton Dual Language Academy, removing automatic attendance rights and forcing incoming families to apply through the magnet lottery[^10].
Neighborhood groups in the Heights warned that losing guaranteed seats at A-rated schools would “100% affect resale prices,” echoing national evidence that test-score shocks transmit quickly to housing markets[^10][^11].

### 2.2 Quantifying the Premium

Academic studies in Texas find that a one-grade improvement on the TEA scale lifts adjacent home values 2-5% within a year[^12].
Realtor.com’s national panel shows a 49% median price gap between homes zoned to 9- or 10-rated schools and those at 6 or below[^11].
Local brokerage analyses confirm the pattern: land inside Houston’s Oak Forest Elementary zone appreciated 145% over the last decade versus a 44% metro average[^13].

### 2.3 Investor Implications

With HISD poised to expand NES to 45 additional campuses in 2025[^14], landlords must track which attendance lines may tighten or disappear.
Conversely, suburban districts adding capacity—such as Katy ISD’s small boundary tweak that shifts Acreage Homes families to a closer junior high—often see a modest bump in subdivision valuations when commute times fall[^15].

## 3. Private-School Enrollment and Capacity

### 3.1 Tuition Inflation and Demand

Average Houston private-school tuition reached \$26,896 for 2024-25, up 5% year-over-year and 21% since 2019; Catholic campuses remain ~22% cheaper at \$20,761 but also raised fees[^16].
Applications rose 30–40% across many west-side schools as parents sought stability during HISD’s state takeover, leaving only 750 open seats metro-wide for fall 2025[^17][^18].

### 3.2 Campus Expansion

The Kinkaid School’s \$180 million “All In” campaign will double upper-school capacity by 2027 while expanding STEM and wellness centers—an unprecedented capital outlay in southern private education[^19].
Mid-tier academies are likewise scaling: YES Prep charter network added 15% enrollment (to 19,473) by opening four campuses in 2024-25[^20].
Construction clustered along Grand Parkway and in Fort Bend reflects where suburbia is adding the most high-income families and where e-commerce job growth is fastest[^2].

### 3.3 Voucher Uncertainty

Although the 2025 Legislature appears set to pass an education-savings-account program, Houston-area heads of school say they lack classroom surplus to absorb a sudden voucher wave and would need several years to expand physical plant[^17].
Consequently, any near-term shift of students from HISD into private seats is likely constrained by supply, limiting downward pressure on urban resale prices.

## 4. Higher-Education Projects and Their Real-Estate Footprint

### 4.1 University of Houston Capital Program

UH launched a \$40 million Centennial campus-beautification plan, broke ground on a \$179 million 1,000-bed freshman hall, and committed \$78 million for a Medical Research Building adjacent to the Fertitta College of Medicine[^21][^22][^23].
Additional projects include a \$65 million Engineering Technology Building in Sugar Land and a \$64 million Dining Commons, each designed to capture suburban enrollment growth and on-campus spending[^23][^24].

![UH’s ambitious building program is reshaping multiple campuses ahead of its 2027 centennial.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/72e32c4bef47572ad525a9951b879487/63041aca-fb37-4b03-bde5-a8e3069cfdac/f3e196a8.png)

UH’s ambitious building program is reshaping multiple campuses ahead of its 2027 centennial.

### 4.2 Satellite Growth Corridors

- Katy: UH closed on 46 acres at I-10/Grand Parkway for a STEM campus slated to serve up to 10,000 students and catalyze a mixed-use “University Center” district[^25][^26].
- Sugar Land: Legislative requests for \$175 million to erect a Health Technology Center were trimmed to \$20 million, but UH pledges to phase build-out from operating funds, keeping local land demand intact[^27].
- Downtown: UHD leased 17,000 ft² at 1801 Main Street for a career-services “Launchpad” and proposed a Crime \& Urban Data Center to anchor Warehouse District redevelopment[^28][^29].


### 4.3 Community-College Pipeline

Houston Community College opened its 125,000 ft² West Houston STEAM building a short walk from UH-Victoria at Katy, giving transfer students a seamless two-plus-two option[^30][^31].
HCC’s strategic plan targets a 30% virtual-reality adoption rate by 2025 and a new peri-operative nursing center in Sugar Land, diversifying employment hubs beyond the Energy Corridor[^32][^33].
San Jacinto College’s online campus will launch in phases through 2027, while its mass-timber Anderson-Ball Classroom Building won ENR’s “Best Project” award and signals institutional investment in the ship-channel east side[^34][^35].

## 5. How Education Trends Shape Property Markets

### 5.1 Premium Persistence

Meta-analysis across 641,000 Houston sales shows homes zoned to A-elementary schools appreciated 54% in a decade, double the metro average, and outperformed even A-rated high-school zones[^13].
Academic work from Northwestern and NBER estimates a \$50,000–\$60,000 incremental valuation for a one-letter-grade district upgrade, controlling for house size and neighborhood amenities[^11][^12].

### 5.2 Suburban Divergence

Katy, Lamar, and Conroe ISDs added 30,553 students combined since 2020, driving demand for new-build inventory on the SH-99 arc, whereas HISD, Aldine, and Pasadena collectively lost 31,222 students, softening inner-loop resale below \$500,000[^2][^9].
Developers are pivoting: 62% of 2024 residential lots delivered lie within A- or B-rated districts, up from 49% five years ago, indicating capital markets price school quality ahead of infrastructure grants[^36].

### 5.3 University District Redevelopment

UH’s Centennial plan will demolish Feresh Hall, add pedestrian groves, and elevate on-campus beds to the second-highest total in Texas, a change expected to lift retail rents along Calhoun Road by 8–12% as the student population nears 46,000[^22][^24].
UHD’s expansion, plus METRORail’s proposed extension to the North Canal, positions the Warehouse District for loft conversions akin to EaDo’s post-2010 cycle, with initial land trades already clearing \$90 psf[^28][^29].

## Conclusion

Educational performance and capacity shifts—from elementary test scores to billion-dollar university build-outs—are now among the strongest location variables in Houston real estate. Investors seeking above-trend appreciation gravitate to Katy, Lamar, Tomball, and Friendswood, where enrollment is swelling and TEA grades remain high, while value-add players monitor HISD’s zoning and facility consolidations for discounted infill opportunities[^1][^8]. Private-school expansion and university capital pipelines further amplify submarket divergence, making diligent school-quality due diligence as integral to underwriting as flood maps or cap-rate comps[^16][^23]. In short, the classroom remains a bellwether for the closing price.
